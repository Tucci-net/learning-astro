# TV Party Tonight!

Published on: 2022-07-01

TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight!

We're gonna have a TV party tonight
All right!
We're gonna have a TV party, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews

Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight
All right!
We'll pass out on the couch, all right
Tonight!

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

We sit glued to the TV set all night
And every night
Why go into the outside world at all
It's such a fright

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews

TV news shows
What it's like out there?
It's a scare
You can go out if you want
We wouldn't dare

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows

I wouldn't be without my TV for a day
Or even a minute
I don't bother to use my brain any more
There's nothing left in it

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews

Wait a minute
My TV set doesn't work
It's broken
What are we gonna do tonight?
This isn't fair
We're hurtin'

We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV
Just a couple of brews

What are we gonna talk about... I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows

No _Random Shows_

No TV party tonight
