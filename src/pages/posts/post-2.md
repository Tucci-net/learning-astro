# No One Knows
We get some rules to follow
That and this
These and those
No one knows

We get these pills to swallow
How they stick
In your throat
Tastes like gold

Oh, what you do to me
No one knows

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
Ah

I journey through the desert
Of the mind
With no hope
I follow

I drift along the ocean
Dead lifeboats in the sun
And come undone

Pleasantly caving in
I come undone

And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
And I realize you're mine
Indeed a fool am I
Ah

Heaven smiles above me
What a gift here below
But no one knows

A gift that you give to me
No one knows
