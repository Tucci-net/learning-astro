            <h2>But First, Some Punk</h2>
            <h3>'13 Stitches ~ NOFX'</h3>
          
            <p>The first time I saw The Descendents
                They were the fastest band I'd ever seen
                No one in the crowd really cared for them
                We were waiting for The Alley Cats to play
                After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl
                On Rodney on the ROQ late Sunday night
                That was enough for me, I hopped the bus
                To Licorice Pizza and bought my all time favorite record</p>
          
            <p>The next time I went to The Whisky
                It was D.O.A. with Millions of Dead Cops
                The latter band played faster than I could believe
                But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked
                Said John Wayne was a Nazi
                And Joey Shithead was a drunk
                Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp
                Cause having long hair was a mistake</p>
                <p>
                    The third time I went to the hospital
                    I needed 13 stitches in my head
                    I managed to catch about 6 songs of Ill Repute
                    Then some suicidal threw me into a post
                    My girlfriend started to cry cause we had to leave
                    Before DRI played 50 lousy songs
                    My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes
                    But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash</p>
                    
            <h2>Anywho who be me?</h2>
            <p>I'm a little punk rocker turned Front End Web Deisgner from bellevue </p>
                    <p>My skills are:</p>
<ul>
  {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
</ul>
